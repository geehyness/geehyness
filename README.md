## 💻 Code Philosophy
Passionate problem-solver who loves crafting code that simplifies life. Whether it's through automation, clean architecture, or intuitive design - I believe in building elegant solutions to complex, everyday challenges.

**Up in the clouds, me and my spouse
**Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
**Please turn them shiz down, can't hear myself think
**Turbulence, shees, almost spilled my drink
**In the White House with a mink
**Running through that bee** like it's my house
**All up in the hall like a mall

**Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball**
**No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to**
**Empty my memory bank**
**It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank**
**Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank**
vPresidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him**
**I'll wait**

**I've been in my wave like 20 years straight**
**I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight**
**Don't fuck up my high, fuck up my high**
**Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie**
**An still be straight (still be straight)**
**Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate**
**Don't waste my breath**
**I don't know how many moons a nigga got left**
**Back to this joint, smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point**
**I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno**
**Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral**
